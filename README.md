# ANN implementation for the demonstrating Keras.


This is the sample code which demonstrates a basic implementation of a newural netork using the Keras deep learning library.

I have used the fertility dataset for the problem because it has a decent number of variables.

Please go through the code line-by-line to understand the same.

#### Important points
 * There is a lot of preprocessing in the python file which is a necessary step when using deep learning. The code for the    model is comparatively small.
